Configure your Pi
The ADXL345 supports both I2C and SPI connections, I used I2C, which requires some configuration on the Pi:

Add the I2C modules to the Pi's configuration: 
sudo nano /etc/modules add the following lines:
i2c-bcm2708
i2c-dev Remove I2C from the blacklist:
sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklist.conf comment out:
blacklist i2c-bcm2708 so its:
#blacklist i2c-bcm2708 Reboot to make the changes:
sudo shutdown -r nowInstall Software
You will need to install some software:
sudo apt-get install python-smbus i2c-tools git-coreTest ADXL345
You can check that your ADXL345 is found on the I2C bus, by running:
sudo i2cdetect -y 1 You should see a device at address 53
